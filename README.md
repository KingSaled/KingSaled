### Welcome to Saled's GitHub ðŸŒŸ

I'm **Saled**, an amateur game developer, digital artist, and perpetually curious mind.

### ðŸŽ® What I'm Up To

As a game developer, I'm currently learning how to bring my imaginary worlds to life using Unity. Check out my repositories for snippets of my journey in game development.

### ðŸŽ¨ Digital Artwork

When I'm not coding, I'm likely drawing in Procreate. My art is influenced by everything from classic video games to contemporary abstract art.

### ðŸ“‚ My Projects

- **Scapeith** An RPG game built with Unity, inspired by RuneScape.
- **Millionaire Moguls**: A card game about the stock market.
